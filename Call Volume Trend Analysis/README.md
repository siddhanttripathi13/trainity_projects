In this project, you'll be diving into the world of Customer Experience (CX) analytics, specifically focusing on the inbound calling team of a company. You'll be provided with a dataset that spans 23 days and includes various details such as the agent's name and ID, the queue time (how long a customer had to wait before connecting with an agent), the time of the call, the duration of the call, and the call status (whether it was abandoned, answered, or transferred).

A Customer Experience (CX) team plays a crucial role in a company. They analyze customer feedback and data, derive insights from it, and share these insights with the rest of the organization. This team is responsible for a wide range of tasks, including managing customer experience programs, handling internal communications, mapping customer journeys, and managing customer data, among others.

In the current era, several AI-powered tools are being used to enhance customer experience. These include Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Predictive Analytics, and Intelligent Routing.

One of the key roles in a CX team is that of the customer service representative, also known as a call center agent. These agents handle various types of support, including email, inbound, outbound, and social media support.

Inbound customer support, which is the focus of this project, involves handling incoming calls from existing or prospective customers. The goal is to attract, engage, and delight customers, turning them into loyal advocates for the business.
